# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression  

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict customer churn in a banking environment. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on their attributes and usage patterns.

##  Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Loaded the customer churn dataset.  
- Explored dataset shape, summary statistics, and column details.  
- Handled categorical variables using **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**.  
- Standardized numerical features with **StandardScaler**.  
- Split the dataset into **training and test sets**.  

### 2. Modeling  
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** as the classification algorithm.  
- Trained the model on the prepared data.  

### 3. Evaluation  
Model performance was assessed using:  
-  **Accuracy Score**  
-  **Confusion Matrix** (visualized with heatmap)  
-  **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
-  **ROC Curve** and **AUC Score**  

### 4. Visualization  
- Confusion Matrix heatmap for error analysis.  
- ROC Curve for classifier performance evaluation.
